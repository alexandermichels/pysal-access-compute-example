# Pysal Access Compute Example

This is an example job for the [CyberGIS-Compute](https://cybergis.github.io/cybergis-compute-python-sdk/index.html) job service using [Pysal's Access package](https://pysal.org/access/index.html) and their example datasets to calculate spatial accessibility.

The job is very simple, but is based on one of [Pysal Access' example notebooks](https://github.com/pysal/access/blob/main/notebooks/Generating%20and%20Plotting%20a%20Variety%20of%20Access%20Scores.ipynb).
